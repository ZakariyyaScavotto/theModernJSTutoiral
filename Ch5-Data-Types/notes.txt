(covered Numbers, Strings, Arrays)

Iterator -lets you make any object iterable

Map - collection of keyed items, where the keys are of any type
- set, get, has, delete, clear, size
- iterate over: keys(), values(), entries() - [key, value]
- entries, fromEntries

Set - set of values where each thing appears once
- add, delete, has, clear, size
- keys, values, entries

WeakMap - map that can't be iterated over and doesn't prevent garbage collection
- usage: additional data storage, caching
WeakSet - translate WeakMap, but set edition

(covered array destructuring)

... operator: gets the rest of the items in array/object and stores in an array/object
