How engines work:
1) Reads the script
2) Compiles to machine language
3) Machine code runs

What in-browser JS can't do:
- Read/write arbitrary files on hard disk, no direct access to OS functions
        - Modern browsers let it work with files, limited access, only provided if user does certain actions like dropping file into browser
        - Can interact with cam/mic/other devices, but require a user's explicit permission
- Different tabs/windows don't know each other, JS from one page can't access other if they come from different sites
    - Pages must agree for data exchange that contains special JS code to handle
- Can easily communicate to the server, but ability to receive data is limited
